# MNIST_Classification_using_NN
The problem we've chosen is referred to as the "Hello World" of deep learning. The goal is to write an algorithm that detects and classifies which digit is written.
We make use of Neural Networks for Classification of the image.

### Dataset
The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. More details can be found on Yann LeCun's website (Director of AI Research, Facebook). He is one of the pioneers of what we've been talking about and of more complex approaches that are widely used today, such as covolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image).

### Results
Accuracy of slightly greater than 96%
